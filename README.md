**Ecosystem Wants to be Free**

By David A. Patterson · Director of RIOS Lab

**RISC-V International Open Source Laboratory** (RIOS Lab) is a Shenzhen-based research facility focused on computer system architecture, supported by the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Research Institute. As an Open Source and Nobel Prize Laboratory, RIOS Lab promotes open-source innovation and collaboration. Our philosophy is that the computer architecture ecosystem should be free for all to access and build upon.

In November 2019, RIOS Lab was officially unveiled. Under the leadership of 2017 A.M. Turing Award winner Prof. David A. Patterson and operational support from TBSI,  RIOS Lab will conduct cutting-edge research in RISC-V hardware and software technology. Patterson first proposed the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), an open and free instruction set architecture enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Released in 2010, the latest Fifth Generation RISC has gained worldwide attention.

The name for the lab RIOS is also inspired by the Spanish word for “rivers.” It symbolizes the flow of information from many sources, coming together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
